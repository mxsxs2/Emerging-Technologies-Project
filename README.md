# Jupyter notebooks
## Iris dataset
The dataset is a collection of samples from three types of Iris flowers. This dataset is commonly used for statistical classification and starter machine learning projects (both supervised and unsupervised)

The dataset contains 150 samples evenly devided between the tree types of flower. The meauserments are taken from the flowers are:
* sepal length
* sepal width
* petal length
* petal width

## MNIST database
The MNIST database is a collection of handwritten images which are used to train a neural network to recognize digits from a paper. MNIST also provides a database for testing the neural network.

The training imeages file contains 60000 images and the test images file contains 10000 images. These files are in a special format therefore they have to be read byte by byte.
