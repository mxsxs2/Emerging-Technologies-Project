## MNIST database
The MNIST database is a collection of handwritten images which are used to train a neural network to recognize digits from a paper. MNIST also provides a database for testing the neural network.

The training imeages file contains 60000 images and the test images file contains 10000 images. These files are in a special format therefore they have to be read byte by byte.
